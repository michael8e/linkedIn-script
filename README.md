## Explanation

1 - The @extends('layouts.app') directive tells Blade to use the app.blade.php layout.

2 - The @section('content') and @endsection define the section that will be inserted into @yield('content') in the layout file.

3 - Inside the home.blade.php, I've created a responsive grid with two columns: one for the main content and another for a sidebar. Both columns use Bootstrap's col-md-8 and col-md-4 classes.

4 - A card component is used for both the content area and the sidebar, which is a common UI pattern in Bootstrap.

## Final Output

When you visit the route associated with this view, you'll see a Bootstrap-styled layout with a responsive grid and cards that adjust based on screen size.
